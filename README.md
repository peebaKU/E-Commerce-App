# E-Commerce-App
 Full-Stack E-Commerce App with Go (Backend) & Vite + React (Frontend)
Now that we've built a Go backend API, let's add a Vite + React frontend to interact with it. The frontend will:
 - ✅ Use React (with Vite) for fast development
 - ✅ Manage User Authentication (JWT)
 - ✅ Fetch and display products
 - ✅ Handle cart and orders
 - ✅ Integrate Stripe for payments
